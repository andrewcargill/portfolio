# Portfolio
I wanted to create a fully custom built frontend website to promote myself and my projects. 

This website should put my skills into action and display my passion for custom designed website designs and builds. 

## Design Goals
- the site should look good on all devices from mobile to large wide-screen displays. The responsive design should work well.
- The site should convay the feel of space and simple effect design through the use of fonts, layouts and response to interactivity from the user.
- The site should be easy to manage and expand.

## The main site design

(add images from the site on various devices)

- color and fonts
- layouts
- buttons and css effects
